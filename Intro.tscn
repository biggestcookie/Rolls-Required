text = "Welcome to Rolls Required, a turn-based game where you roll dice to attack and gain upgrades after each combat.

On each turn, enemies will roll 2 different numbers: one lucky number and one cursed number.
On your turn, you may select one die and then select an enemy as your target.
When you roll a die, that die cannot be used again for that turn.
If you do not roll any chance number, you will attack that enemy for the amount rolled and enemies will perform their turn. Then, it will be your turn again.
If you roll the enemy's lucky number, you will do additional damage, block the enemy's attack, and can roll again that turn if there are still available dice.
However, if you roll the enemy's cursed number, your attack will be canceled and the enemy will do double damage to you.

After defeating all enemies in a combat, you will be able to select one of three random upgrades. To use them, select the die/dice you wish to use, then select the upgrade you want.

Your health and dice stay persistent throughout the game, so be sure to try and minimize damage taken and plan out the kinds of risks you want to take in order to make it as far as you can!"
